# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [0.2.4.0] - 2026-03-22

### Added
- **Big Purchase OS** (`big_purchase` scenario): routes laptop, headphone, and smartphone queries through a new decision planner that produces one clear primary recommendation + up to 2 backup alternatives — no more comparing specs across 10 cards
- **Execution Deep Links** (`open_link` PlanAction type): surfaces Amazon purchase links and other secondary actions (Maps, Calendar, hotel/flight booking) from all scenario planners into the ActionRail as clickable buttons — first link gets solid gold background, others get gold outline
- **`parseBigPurchaseIntent`** + **`runBigPurchasePlanner`**: new planners in `lib/agent/planners/big-purchase.ts` that extract product category, budget, OS preference, and use case from natural language, then build a `DecisionPlan` reusing existing laptop/headphone/smartphone pipelines
- **`mapLinksToOpenLinkActions`** utility (`lib/agent/planners/utils.ts`): shared helper that converts `PlanLinkAction[]` to `PlanAction[type="open_link"][]` with outcome tracking
- **BackupPlanCard tradeoff rendering**: when `tradeoff_reason` is set, it replaces the label; `tradeoff_detail` replaces the summary — backup cards now explain the trade-off instead of showing a generic "Backup 1" label
- **20 new tests** covering `detectScenarioFromMessage` big_purchase detection, `parseBigPurchaseIntent`, and `runBigPurchasePlanner` across null/valid/budget/category/language/tradeoff scenarios

### Changed
- **ActionRail** now owns execution deep links exclusively — `PrimaryPlanCard` no longer renders `secondary_actions`, preventing duplicate link rendering
- `detectScenarioFromMessage`: big_purchase detection added at lowest priority (after city_trip, weekend_trip, date_night), triggered by product category keyword + budget signal or purchase intent verb

## [0.2.3.0] - 2026-03-22

### Added
- **Share page** (`/plan/[id]`): read-only plan view for sharing with a partner — renders primary plan, backup options, and a "This works for me" approval button
- **Partner approval API** (`POST /api/plan/[id]/outcome`): records `partner_approved` outcome to `plan_outcomes` table; GET variant supports calendar deep-link outcomes (`?type=went`)
- **Plan save/fetch API** (`POST /api/plan/save`, `GET /api/plan/[id]`): persists `DecisionPlan` to `decision_plans` table; share action in the main UI saves plan and copies shareable URL
- **Refinement lineage** (`parent_plan_id`): when you refine a plan, Folio now tracks which plan it came from — enabling full refinement chains and future analysis of whether refining led to better outcomes
- **Venue intelligence** (`getScoreAdjustments`): real user outcomes now power a recency-weighted venue ranking model (30-day decay); activate with `ENABLE_SCORE_ADJUSTMENTS=true` once ≥30 days + ≥100 outcomes have been recorded

### Fixed
- **Test type errors**: fixed pre-existing TypeScript errors in `getScoreAdjustments.test.ts` (`"group_dinner"` → `"big_purchase"`), `scenario2.test.ts` (`"vibrant"` → `"mixed"`, missing `scenario_goal`), and `plan-outcome.test.ts` (QueryResult mock types)

## [0.2.2.0] - 2026-03-22

### Added
- **City trip scenario** (`city_trip`): new scenario that builds 3 tiered packages (Upscale / Trendy / Local vibe) combining hotel + restaurant + bar recommendations for multi-night city visits — ask things like "3 nights in Tokyo, want great food and nightlife"
- **Modular planner engine** (`lib/agent/planner-engine/`): generic tiered-package engine that can power any trip scenario; replaces per-scenario boilerplate with configuration — new scenarios now only need an `EngineConfig` factory instead of 400+ lines of custom code
- **City trip NLU detection**: `detectScenarioFromMessage` now recognizes city trip queries (destination + hotel + activities) and routes to the `city_trip` planner; includes priority logic to prefer `weekend_trip` when flight signals are present
- **City trip clarification flow**: when the agent needs more info (missing destination, dates, etc.), users now see a clear "I need one or two more details" message instead of silent fallthrough
- **City Trip analytics filter tab**: internal analytics dashboard now has a City Trip filter alongside Date Night, Weekend Trip, and Big Purchase

### Fixed
- **Analytics scenario filter** (`lib/scenarioEvents.ts`): `city_trip` was missing from `VALID_SCENARIOS` set — analytics queries filtered by city_trip scenario returned nothing silently; now included

## [0.2.1.1] - 2026-03-21

### Fixed
- **Telemetry scenario validation** (`app/api/telemetry/route.ts`): scenario events were written to DB without server-side validation of the `scenario` field — any client could insert arbitrary strings, silently corrupting `GROUP BY scenario` analytics queries; now validated against `VALID_SCENARIO_TYPES` allowlist before insert

## [0.2.1.0] - 2026-03-21

### Added
- **Agent sub-module split** (`lib/agent/`): extracted parsers, pipelines, and planners into 21 focused modules (`parse/`, `pipelines/`, `planners/`, `composer/`) — `lib/agent.ts` is now a thin orchestrator
- **ScenarioPlanView component** (`components/ScenarioPlanView.tsx`): consolidated scenario plan rendering (ScenarioBrief + PrimaryPlanCard + BackupPlanCard + ActionRail + ScenarioEvidencePanel) into one composable component

### Fixed
- **DB singleton reset on transient failure** (`lib/db.ts`): `ensureScenarioEventsTable` cached rejected Promises permanently — now resets on failure so the next call retries
- **Weekend trip detection false positive** (`lib/scenario2.ts`): hotel-only or flight-only queries ("find a hotel this weekend") no longer trigger the trip-package flow — requires BOTH flight AND hotel signals
- **Near Me mode departure city** (`lib/agent.ts`): passed `"your current location"` as flight departure instead of the real city name — weekend trip flight search now uses `city.fullName`
- **Stale scenario brief after backup promotion** (`app/hooks/useChat.ts`): `swapDecisionPlanOption` spread stale `scenario_brief`, `risks`, and `evidence_items` from the original primary plan — now reset on swap
- **SW navigation caching** (`public/sw.js`): all navigation responses were cached under `"/"`, overwriting the app shell with any page response — now only caches root navigations
- **Duplicate trip packages in limited inventory** (`lib/scenario2.ts`): `runWeekendTripPlanner` deduplicated flight+hotel combos before building backup plans — no more identical packages with different labels
- **Analytics access control** (`lib/scenarioEvents.ts`): when `INTERNAL_ANALYTICS_USER_IDS` env var was unset, any signed-in user could access raw analytics — now denies all access when allowlist is empty
- **Vitest picking up .claude/ worktrees** (`vitest.config.ts`): added exclude for `**/.claude/**` to prevent gstack internal tests and worktree snapshots from being included in test runs

### Changed
- **app/page.tsx**: replaced 5 individual scenario component imports with `ScenarioPlanView`

## [0.2.0.0] - 2026-03-21

### Added
- **Scenario decision engine** (`lib/scenario2.ts`, 1439L): `detectScenario`, `detectScenarioFromMessage`, `parseScenarioIntent`, `runScenarioPlanner` (date_night), `runWeekendTripPlanner` — full SSE-streaming scenario pipeline
- **Weekend trip planner**: 3-option DecisionPlan (stable/value/experience) from parallel hotel + flight searches
- **Date night planner**: `DecisionPlan` with backup options from restaurant search + scoring
- **NLU layer** (`lib/nlu.ts`): `analyzeMultilingualQuery` with MiniMax-backed multilingual support and English fast-path (skips API for pure English queries)
- **MiniMax client** (`lib/minimax.ts`): shared chat helper with configurable timeout (30s default, 60s for hotel ranking)
- **Internal analytics** (`app/api/internal/scenario-events/`, `lib/scenarioEvents.ts`): `GET /api/internal/scenario-events` with query parsing, days/limit clamping, Clerk-gated access
- **Internal analytics UI** (`app/internal/scenario-events/`): Clerk-gated analytics dashboard page
- **Scenario components**: `ActionRail`, `PrimaryPlanCard`, `BackupPlanCard`, `ScenarioBrief`, `ScenarioEvidencePanel`
- **Telemetry** (`app/api/telemetry/`): `plan_approved`, `option_swap`, `action_rail_click` events with DB persistence
- **TODOS.md**: P2 backlog items for `lib/agent.ts` split and `ScenarioPlanView` extraction
- **90 tests** across 5 test files covering all new code paths

### Changed
- `app/api/chat/route.ts`: SSE pipeline branches on `resultMode` — `scenario_plan` routes to scenario engine, `category_cards` preserves existing pipeline
- `app/page.tsx`: renders `ScenarioBrief + PrimaryPlanCard + ActionRail` for scenario_plan mode alongside existing card list
- `lib/agent.ts`: `parseIntent` now respects `scenario_hint` from NLU context; `detectCategory` uses `category_hint` fast-path
- `lib/types.ts`: added `DecisionPlan`, `PlanOption`, `ActionItem`, `ScenarioContext`, `WeekendTripIntent`, `DateNightIntent`, `FlightRecommendationCard`, `HotelRecommendationCard`

### Fixed
- **MiniMax timeout** (`lib/minimax.ts`): global timeout raised 8s→30s; hotel ranking uses 60s to prevent pipeline hangs
- **False weekend_trip detection** (`lib/scenario2.ts`): "round trip flights" and "business trip hotel" queries now correctly route as `flight`/`hotel`, not `weekend_trip` (regression ISSUE-002)
- **Open analytics in production** (`lib/scenarioEvents.ts`): `requireInternalAnalyticsAccess` now returns 403 in production when Clerk is not configured (security fix, ISSUE-002-security)
- **English NLU latency** (`lib/nlu.ts`): English queries skip MiniMax call entirely — ~300ms saved per query (ISSUE-004)
