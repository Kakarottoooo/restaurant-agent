Person A: "${initiatorConstraints}"
Person B: "${partnerConstraints}"

Rules for merging:
- Hard constraint UNION: if either person has a hard exclusion ("no raw fish", "not too loud", "vegan"), it applies to both
- Budget: use the LOWER of the two budgets as the ceiling
- Cuisine preferences: include both if they don't conflict; if they conflict, note it
- Noise/atmosphere: use the stricter preference
- CONFLICT: declare conflict ONLY if constraints are truly incompatible (e.g. "vegan only" + "must have steak", "halal only" + "must have pork")
